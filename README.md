# evobpso

## Overview
evobpso is a toolbox for automatically designing neural architectures for image classification
based on evolutionary/swarm optimization algorithms.
The current version of the toolbox is using Boolean Particle Swarm Optimization [1] in a global optimization setting.


## Requirements
See the associated setup.py file.
Briefly, the algorithm works with Tensorflow 2, although other libraries can be used as well.


## Tests
Unit tests are small tests aimed to run quickly before commiting.
Integration tests on the other hand, actually go through the full optimization process, so they may take a very long time.
